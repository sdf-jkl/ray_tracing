## Motivation

Walked upon [@matklad](https://github.com/matklad)'s blog post where he mentions that one of the best ways to learn a programming language is by writing a ray tracer — so I decided to give it a shot.

In his post, he links to [*Build Your Own 3D Renderer* by Avik Das](https://avikdas.com/build-your-own-raytracer/) for folks who aren’t confident with the math side of things, recommending it as a source to look up the necessary formulas. I decided to check it out... and ended up deciding to follow it all the way through.
